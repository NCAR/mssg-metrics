- restore DB2 backup image from 08Jun2015

- as hpssdb, run "gather-inter-access-times-from-db.sh"

- the counts from the "gather-inter-access-times-from-db.sh" script were manually added to the  "disk-cache-size-1.Rmd" script

- as hpssdb, run the following query to obtain the read counts for files created in the past five years:

	db2 "select bfattr_read_count from hpss.bitfile where bfattr_create_time > 1275976800 for read only with ur"

- cleanup this output file a little bit to make it easier to parse by R (e.g., remove column header, trailing info and add
  a column name)

- run the "disk-cache-size-1.Rmd" script via Rstudio to generate the report
